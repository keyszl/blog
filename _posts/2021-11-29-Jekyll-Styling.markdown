**Adding a Little Spice:**

I had no idea that there were all these different templates and [Jekyll themes](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/). Looking at them was interesting, and overriding their defaults with my own changes was something new I learned. I struggled a little bit with getting my header set-up properly, but I managed to figure it out. I'm a little afraid to try using a different theme than minima, because I would have to change everything over, but I may do that in the future. I am looking forward to seeing how my posts progress and how my website changes in future [labs](https://hendrix-cs.github.io/csci340/#labs) when I gain more knowledge, and how I can explore with jekyll and get outside of my comfort zone.

- What do you mean minima isn't the only jekyll theme?
