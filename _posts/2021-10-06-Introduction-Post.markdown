**The Blog Experience:**

Setting up this blog while challenging was rewarding. I have never created a blog that wasn't premade through some sort of website.
Installing ruby and making sure all the jekyll files were installed properly was the most challenging, especially because I wasn't
entirely sure what was happening in the installation process. It was just tons of lines in my terminal, but I understand that it was
simply if I were running an actual installer with a GUI just that it was in my terminal.
I am still confused as to how to format text and change the web layout to make it look all fancy, but that's something I will learn in time.

I am looking forward to making new posts and getting more comfortable with jekyll so I can make cooler blog posts for future labs.

**Here is my list of some of my favorite activities:**
1. E-Sports
2. Computer Science Club
3. Poetry
