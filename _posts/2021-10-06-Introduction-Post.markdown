Write a new post titled “Introduction Post”, describing your setup experience in this blog. What parts were new to you? What parts did you struggle with? What parts still do not make sense? What are you looking forward to? Your post must include at least two links and a list.

Create a _drafts/ folder, and move the “Welcome to Jekyll” file into this new drafts directory.

The Blog Experience:

Setting up this blog while challenging was rewarding. I have never created a blog that wasn't premade through some sort of website.
Installing ruby and making sure all the jekyll files were installed properly was the most challenging, especially because I wasn't
entirely sure what was happening in the installation process. It was just tons of lines in my terminal, but I understand that it was
simply if I were running an actual installer with a GUI just that it was in my terminal.

I am looking forward to making new posts and getting more comfortable with jekyll so I can make cooler blog posts for future labs.
